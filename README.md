== Description ==

This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm of the developer. When activated you will see a click-able link in the upper right of your admin screen on every page. These links will alternate between a set of options on each page load. 

The options enable the logged in user to submit a support request directly from their managed website.
